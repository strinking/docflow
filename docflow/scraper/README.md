# `scraper` subdirectory
This subdirectory houses a scrapy project
which is used to extract documentation from
various websites.

While this directory itself - apart from `util.py` -
contains important files for the scrapy project,
it is probably not of big interest. However, it is
possible to add things like statistics to this module
through the classes found in the autogenerated files.
For example, one could track how many items are scraped
on a per-language basis.

The `spiders` subdirectory houses the source code
for the scrapy spiders used to scrape documentation data.
Be careful with any modifications to these files, as their
proper function is hard to validate.
