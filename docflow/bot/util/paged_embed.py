"""
This module defines two classes
for creating so-called paged Embeds.

Paged Embeds are a special type of
message through which other Users
can navigate through Reactions.
The content of each "page" is
an Embed, effectively allowing the
developer to contain 20 embeds
in a single message.

By default, paged Embeds stop
responding to reactions after
5 minutes. This interval can be
changed through the variable
    EMBED_EXPIRY
, which sets the interval for
an embed to "expire", in minutes.
This is achieved through using
    threading.Timer
, which is started when
the message is sent.
"""

from threading import Timer

import discord
from discord.ext import commands

# After how many minutes the PagedEmbed should ignore reactions
EMBED_EXPIRY = 5.0


class EmbedPage(discord.Embed):
    """
    A subclass of discord.Embed
    which represents a single
    page of content in a PagedEmbed.
    """


class PagedEmbed:
    """
    A custom type that implements
    a collection of EmbedPages which
    are navigatable through reactions.

    The PagedEmbed will attach an
    event listener for the reaction
    add event which it uses to edit
    its content independently without
    having to override the default
    on_reaction_add method from the
    client. To avoid infinitely
    cluttering up the handlers for the
    reaction add event, sending the
    PagedEmbed will start a
    threading.Timer which automatically
    deattaches the event handler from
    the bot after the interval set in
    the variable EMBED_EXPIRY, in minutes.
    This defaults to removing the handler
    after five minutes, but simply
    assigning another value to the
    variable will change this behavior

    for all PagedEmbeds that are sent
    after it was changed.

    Please note that the bot requires
    a set of permissions for the
    PagedEmbed to work properly:
    - Sending Messages
        Should be fairly obvious why.
    - Adding Reactions
        For showing the users which
        reactions result in "browsing"
        different pages in the message.
    - Manage Messages
        For removing reactions after
        users added them to navigate
        the PagedEmbed.
    - (Use External Emojis)
        Optional, if you want to use
        external emojis for the embed
        pages (the Bot needs this
        permission in order to be able
        to react with the external
        emojis you pass to add_page).

    It is currently only possible to
    use this with discord.py's commands
    extension as it requires the
    `add_listener` method which the
    regular discord.Client class does
    not implement.

    Example:

        # Inside your Cog...
        @commands.command()
        async def colours(self, ctx):
            embed = PagedEmbed(ctx, bot, "üçè",
                title="Green!",
                description="An apple a day keeps the code debt away.",
                colour=discord.Colour.green()
