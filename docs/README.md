# docflow
Chances are that you stumbled across this repository and asked yourself *"What is this"*?
These documentation files aim to explain what this project is about and how to use it yourself.

### What is docflow?
Docflow is a combination of a Discord Bot and a collection of scrapy spiders to
scrape documentation for various languages. 
The Discord Bot *itself* can more or less only evaluate code.
However, since the bot loads reference files into memory, it will
currently not start without scraping any data.
They are designed to work together, but it is also possible to
use them yourself in other projects. A module to ease doing this will
be added later.


### How do I use this project?
If you simply wish to run the Discord Bot, follow the instructions in `README.md`.
